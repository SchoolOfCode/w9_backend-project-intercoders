1) why/for what are you using the procfile?

App.js
-> line 5 > delete comment?
-> line 15 > delete?

Routes
- ALL THE ROUTES
        line 6 -> could you clarify why are you using the router.use(express.json()) in announcement again, instead of leaving just on the app.js ?

-- Waiting list
    line 9 -> delete? are you still going to use?

    -> Did you think about filtering the students by course, and creating different tables by course? 

    -> line 34 to 40 -> could you clarify the use of the route?If is not being used, could we remove it? 
    
    -- Models
    line 1
    Why import application if we aren't using it at the moment ?
